> Pseudonymize FHIRðŸ”¥ resources from and to MongoDB databases

This is a command line tool to run pseudonymization / anonymization on FHIR resources via the
[FHIRÂ® Pseudonymizer](https://github.com/miracum/fhir-pseudonymizer).
It currently supports reading from a MongoDB database. Data from all collections are send to the FHIR pseudonymization
service and written back to a target database and its collections accordingly.

## Usage

The project name is the only _required_ command line flag to provide when running the tool.
It is used by convention as a suffix to determine the source database (`idat_fhir_[project]`).
The target database name is set to `psn_fhir_[project]`.

Configuration properties are set via a YAML file which defaults to `app.yaml`.

```
Usage:
  pseudonymous [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --config string    config file (default is ./app.yaml)
  -h, --help             help for pseudonymous
  -p, --project string   project name (required)
```

## Installation

Binary releases and docker images are available under
[releases](https://github.com/diz-unimr/pseudonymous/releases).
